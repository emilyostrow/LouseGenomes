# LouseGenomes
This github is a repository for creating a reference genome from short read sequencing and calling SNPs using that genome. I found that for a more heterozygous species, it is helpful to create a scaffold file using all reads and then use those scaffolds as an untrusted source to align high-quality reads to. This leads to a much more realistic genome size and larger contigs than just using unfiltered or filtered SNPs. It is important to remove scaffolds below a certain length if you have many because too many thousands of scaffolds will exponentially increase GATK run times. Also, any SNPs that are found on smaller scaffolds may be linked with other SNPs. I chose to remove scaffolds below 10kb here to reduce runtimes and lessen concerns about linkage by using a standard window size.
